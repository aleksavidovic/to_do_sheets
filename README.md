# To Do Sheets
To do sheets is a simple to-do web app that uses Google Sheets as a backend / storage. 

It's a project that I'm building for a "Web design" class that I'm taking for my Software Engineering degree.

Since hte specification of the project says that you're supposed to be building only the frontend of the website and only use third party APIs, I decided to go with Google Sheets as a "backed" for this project.
